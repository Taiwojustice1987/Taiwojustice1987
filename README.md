Cloud Security Engineer | DevSecOps Engineer | Solutions Architect

Results-driven Cloud Security Engineer with over 6 years of hands-on experience securing and automating large-scale AWS and multi-account cloud environments. I specialize in Zero Trust security architectures, infrastructure as code (Terraform), DevSecOps automation, and cloud governance, with proven impact across financial services, fintech, and enterprise platforms.

My work focuses on building secure-by-design cloud infrastructure, automating security controls, and embedding compliance into CI/CD pipelines. I have led cloud security initiatives that reduced unauthorized access by 65%, improved compliance posture to 94% (CIS benchmarks), and cut incident detection times from hours to minutes.

On GitHub, I maintain and publish production-grade cloud security frameworks, Terraform modules, and automation tools that demonstrate real-world security engineering—not demos.
